# Data Analysis Tools for University Physics Experiments Courses of TJU
This is a repo built for TJU's "University Physics Experiments" courses, a pointless, frustrating ordeal forced on students. Hours of useless labs with outdated equipment, leaving everyone annoyed and exhausted. No one learns anything meaningful, but it's mandatory, so we’re all wasting time in it.
However, life must go on, so I created these automation tools to handle experiment data. They're primarily for my own use, but if any TJU's poor inmates stumble across this repo, I hope these imperfect, error-filled scripts (btw I appreciate GPT as my loyal debugger, despites its sometimes noob-like code almost drove me crazy) can save you some time and sanity. You should spend that time reading books, watching movies—*The Grand Budapest Hotel* and *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* are great picks (just saying). But seriously, this repo is far from being perfect, so treat it as a tool, not a crutch—don’t rely on it completely.

## Exp 1 Verification of Newton's Second Law
This contains 3 sub-experiments, which I won't waste any time trying to decribe in English. We will only mention some of the bugs that appears in my code.

### Exp 1-1
### Exp 1-2
### Exp 1-3
The format function in the code is still incompleted. Bug exists. Hard to write the logic, so I won't fix.
